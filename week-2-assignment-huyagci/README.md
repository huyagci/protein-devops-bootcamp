#### :hash: **Assignment**

> Create a bash script that helps the developer to build a project[^1] on a specified branch in a working git repository.

**Script has to be able to ;**

> - Switch between branches and build from a given branch upon user requests.
> - Warn the user if the branch is main or master.
> - Create a new branch upon user requests.
> - Enable/disable debug mode of maven. _(Default must be disabled)_
> - Allow users to specify the compressed archive format as "zip" or "tar.gz" formats. _(Default must be "tar.gz")_
> - Terminate if any other compressed algorithms are given. _(Must use the default if not specified)_
> - Set the archive name as the selected branch name.
> - Set the output directory for compressed archives upon user requests. _(Default must be the working directory)_

### :notebook_with_decorative_cover: **Overview**

This repository contains an assignment project developed under the [Patika.dev][@patika] & [Protein][@protein] DevOps Engineer Bootcamp. **Bootstrapper** is an initializer script that sets up the machine as instructed. `Git Buddy` is an auxiliary script to manage multiple git instances and was originally not a part of the assignment. `Build Expert` is the main script that is coded by the terms of the project.

### :sparkles: **Features**

#### _Bootstrapper_

> - Sets the timezone of the machine as UTC+3 (Europe/Istanbul) and enables Network Time Protocol.
> - Downloads the latest package information.
> - Downloads, installs, and configures Java 18, Apache Maven 3.8.5 , and the latest version of Git SCM.
> - Sets the environment variables for the stated technologies above.
> - Sets the permissions of the script files.
> - Defines system-wide aliases for the scripts for easy use.

#### _Git Buddy_

> - The main goal of this script is to assist the `Build Expert` script by managing multiple git repositories simultaneously.
> - Searches for all initialized git repositories under the project directory.
> - Can terminate all git repositories at the same time.
> - Can initialize git instances for all directories under the project directory simultaneously.

#### _Build Expert_

> - Manages git and maven package manager to fulfill the tasks given by the user.
> - Switches between branches and build the project depending on the user requests.
> - Warns the user if the branch is main or master.
> - Creates a new branch and build the project from it if specified.
> - Enables or disables maven debug mode and quiet mode. Also can skip tests.
> - Can create compressed artifacts of the project as "zip" or "tar.gz" formats.
> - Renames the archive files as `branchName.zip` or `branchName.tar.gz` automatically.
> - Sets output directory to user-specified directory.
> - Cleans the target directory of the maven project.

### :gear: **Installation**

##### _Automated_

1. Install [VirtualBox][@virtualbox] and [Vagrant][@vagrant-download] to your machine _if you do not have them_.
2. Clone the project to your machine.
3. Open your CLI, change directory to project directory, and type `vagrant up`.
4. Vagrant will configure the virtual machine first then you may test the project.

##### _Manual_

1. Download all of the project files.
2. Copy all scripts under the `/shared/scripts` and sample project from `/shared/project/java` to your environment.
3. Execute `bootstrap.sh` first to configure the machine settings.
4. Run the scripts with the aliases configured or manually from the directories that are stated [**below**](#open_file_folder-directories).

### :wrench: **Usage**

- Built-in aliases are `gitbuddy` and `buildexpert`. You may execute them if you executed `bootstrap.sh` first.
- Optionally, you may call the scripts from any directory with an acceptable arguments that are stated below.
- The target directory of _Git Buddy_ scripts is `/opt/project` directory.
- The target directory of _Build Expert_ scripts is `/opt/project/java` directory.
- You can change these settings by re-defining the `TARGET_DIR` variable within the scripts.
